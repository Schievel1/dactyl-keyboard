# This file overrides the settings in the run_config.json or whatever base configuration file you may load.
# Its intent is to have a simple, clear, short file for configuring specific settings where the critical changes
# are all plain to see in one place.
#
# You can specify the location of this path in run_config.json via the "overrides" value.
#
# My use for this feature has primarily been to keep track of the specific build needs for my customers
# at Wylderbuilds, but it also comes in extremely handy for iterating various settings when testing code changes.
#
# And COMMENTS!  You can add comments to yaml or comment out lines to swap among config settings with ease
# and document in place WHY THE HELL YOU DID THAT CRAZY THING.

# In the default setup here, nothing is overridden so you'll just get the settings as specified in
# run_config.json
